# ravelin-java

Java library which helps integrate your Java application to Ravelin, a fraud detection tool. (https://www.ravelin.com/).

Installation (using Maven)
-

_There is no deployed artefacts at the time of writing_ so you have to build it yourself. Fork the repository and run `mvn install`.

_Apache Maven 3+ is required to build the artefact._

How to use
-

#### What it does:
Serialize and deserialize Ravelin Java classes to JSON format String and vice-versa.

#### What it doesn't do:
Send the request to Ravelin itself. This was not integrated to the library purely because your application might already have an implementing client (like Jersey, RestEasy) which one could useâ€”adding an in-built client is highly opinionated and might cause classloading issues.

Refer to _Sending a Request Using RestEasy v2.x_ below for a client example.

#### Some examples

Create Customer
```
Location location = new Location("James St", null, null, null, "Darwen", "Blackburn with Darwen", "GBR", null, "BB3 1AS", 53.697471d, -2.470891d, null);

Customer customer = new Customer("61283761287361",
                                       1429029731,
                                       null,
                                       "Mark",
                                       "Twain",
                                       null,
                                       null,
                                       "marktwain@gmail.com",
                                       null,
                                       "mtwain",
                                       null,
                                       null,
                                       null,
                                       location,
                                       null,
                                       "lon");

customer.addCustom("newsletter", false);
customer.addCustom("invitedBy", "7198737117");

CustomerEvent event = new CustomerEvent(1429029735, null, customer, null);
String $customer_json = event.toJSON(); // serializing the request, ready for Ravelin
```

Pre-Transaction Event
```
   PreTransaction preTransaction = new PreTransaction("f61f8594e06459fa046707c36159bb35", "james.tate@gmail.com", "GBP", 4675, 0, null, TransactionType.AUTH, null);
   PreTransactionEvent event = new PreTransactionEvent(1429029735, "61283761287361", null, null, "783917", "n1QSYK0ceGNZqU28ien3", preTransaction, null, null);
   String $pretransaction_json = event.toJSON(); // serializing the request, ready for Ravelin
```

Label Customer
```
Reviewer reviewer = new Reviewer("Bilbo Baggins", "bilbo.b@shiremail.com");
LabelCustomerEvent event = new LabelCustomerEvent("customer1", Label.GENUINE, "This customer called up and we have determined he is not a fraudster", reviewer);

String $label_json = event.toJSON(); // serializing the request, ready for Ravelin
```

Deserializing an HTTP response:
```
String $response = // fetch response from your client
RavelinResponse response = RavelinResponse.parse(responseContent);
```

Sending a Request Using RestEasy v2.x
-

```
protected static RavelinResponse send(String url, String apiKey, String json, boolean getScore) throws RavelinException, IOException {

        HttpResponse response;
        String responseContent;
        {
            HttpClient client = HttpClientBuilder.create().setHostnameVerifier(new AllowAllHostnameVerifier()).build();

            final URI uri;
            try {
                uri = new URIBuilder(url).addParameter("score", Boolean.toString(getScore)).build();
            } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException("An error has occured while trying to generate the request URI", e);
            }
            HttpPost request = new HttpPost(uri);
            request.addHeader("Authorization", format("token %s", apiKey));
            request.addHeader("Accept", ContentType.APPLICATION_JSON.getMimeType());
            request.setEntity(new StringEntity(json, ContentType.APPLICATION_JSON));

            response = client.execute(request);
            List<String> contentLineList = IOUtils.readLines(response.getEntity().getContent());
            responseContent = contentLineList.stream().reduce("", (a, b) -> a + '\n' + b);
        }

        final RavelinResponse ravelinResponse;
        {
            final RavelinStatusCode ravelinResponseCode = RavelinStatusCode.resolve(response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
            switch (ravelinResponseCode) {
                case OK:
                    ravelinResponse = RavelinResponse.parse(responseContent);
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new RavelinException(ravelinResponseCode,
                                               format("Http error response received from Ravelin when trying to attempt to send json [%s] to URL [%s] - [%s]",
                                                      json,
                                                      url,
                                                      responseContent));
            }
        }

        return ravelinResponse;
    }
```
